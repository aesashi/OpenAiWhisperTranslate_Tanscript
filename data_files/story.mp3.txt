It was a Thursday but it felt like a Monday to John and John loved Mondays.
He thrived at work, he dismissed the old clich√© of treading Monday mornings and refused
to engage in a water cooler complaint about the grind and the empty conversations that included
the family parry.
How was your weekend too short?
Yes, John liked his work and was unshamed.
